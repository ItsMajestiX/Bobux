# BobuxServer

The server that the Bobux plugin talks to, as well as any applications that you might want to use to get data, like a discord bot or a website.

## Why isn't the discord bot here?

1. I haven't even made that yet, so I have no idea what you're talking about.
2. The idea was for the server to not have anything extra in it, so that you don't have to run the bot if you don't want to.
